# Tasks from Codewars.com 


Notes:  

- All tasks passed successfully all test cases in codewars.com.

- The tasks are being solved in one class which is provided by codewars.com. 

- For all tasks Test class with test cases is provided. 

- Most of the tests are hidden in codewars.com, this is why i've introduced my own test cases (it will be mentioned with comments in the Test class).

- Tasks are written in Java 11 and tested with JUnit 4.12. Maven dependency:

  <dependency>  
      <groupId>junit</groupId>  
      <artifactId>junit</artifactId>  
      <version>4.12</version>  
      <scope>test</scope>  
  </dependency>
