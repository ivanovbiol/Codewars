# Tasks from Codewars.com 


Notes:  

- All tasks passed successfully all test cases in codewars.com.

- The tasks are being solved in one class which is provided by codewars.com. 

- For all tasks Test class with test cases is provided. 

- Most of the tests are hidden in codewars.com, this is why i've introduced my own test cases (it will be mentioned with comments in the Test class).

- Tasks are written in Java 11 and tested with JUnit 4.12. Maven dependency download -> https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/junit/junit/4.12
