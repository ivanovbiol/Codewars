# Tasks from Codewars.com 


Notes:  

- There are no Main, Reader and Writer classes in the original tasks in codewars.com. I have introduced such classes in my tasks in order to design them as complete programs.  

- The input data is being read from the console of IntelliJ IDEA.  

- Every new simple input (an integer, a String, etc.) should be writtten on a new line in the console.  

- If the input is sequence of elements (Array) they should be written on a single line separated by coma and followed by space or only space depending on the task (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 1 2 3 4 5). Every new sequence of elements (if such is required) should be written on a new line.    

- If the format of the input is different it will be mentioned in the task description.
