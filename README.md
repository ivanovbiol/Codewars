# Tasks from Codewars.com 


Notes:  

- There are no Main and Reader classes in codewars.com. I have introduced such classes in my tasks in order to design them as complete programs.  

- The input data is being read from the console of IntelliJ IDEA.  

- Every new input (integer, String, etc.) should be writtten on a new line in the console.  

- If the input is sequence of elements (Array) the elements should be written on a single line separated by coma followed by space (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).
