Complete the function so that it finds the mean of the three scores passed to it and returns the letter value associated with that grade.  

| Numerical Score     | Letter Grade |  
|---------------------|--------------|
| 90 <= score <= 100  |     'A'      |  
| 80 <= score < 90    |     'B'      |  
| 70 <= score < 80    |     'C'      |  
| 60 <= score < 70    |     'D'      |  
| 0 <= score < 60     |     'F'      |  

Valid values are all between 0 (inclusive) and 100 (inclusive).
